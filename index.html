        <h2>Why Iceland?</h2>
        <h3>Iceland is a magical island that lies just below the Arctic Circle</h3>
        <p>
          As the least-populated country in Europe, you will find wide-open spaces and vast areas of untouched wilderness in Iceland. Abundant natural beauty is around every corner with unparalleled scenery unlike anywhere else. Iceland lies on the border of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, which means the island's landmass grows each year as it pulls apart. Due to this tectonic activity, Iceland has extremely active volcanoes and black volcanic rock litters the island.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iceland is also incredibly safe and family-friendly. Traveling with children to this island is easy from both Europe and the United States, with quick, direct flights daily. Many families rent cars and travel safely from adventure to adventure. My children highly recommend the rye icecream and crunchy, fresh fish and chips after a long day of exploration.
