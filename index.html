        <h2>Why Iceland?</h2>
        <h3>Iceland is a magical island that lies just below the Arctic Circle</h3>
        <p>
          As the least-populated country in Europe, you will find wide-open spaces and vast areas of untouched wilderness in Iceland. Abundant natural beauty is around every corner with unparalleled scenery unlike anywhere else. Iceland lies on the border of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, which means the island's landmass grows each year as it pulls apart. Due to this tectonic activity, Iceland has extremely active volcanoes and black volcanic rock litters the island.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iceland is also incredibly safe and family-friendly. Traveling with children to this island is easy from both Europe and the United States, with quick, direct flights daily. Many families rent cars and travel safely from adventure to adventure. My children highly recommend the rye icecream and crunchy, fresh fish and chips after a long day of exploration.

              <h4>Hallgr√≠mskirkja Church</h4>
              <p>
                Situated on the hilltop Sk√≥lav√∂r√∞uholt near the center of Reykjavik, the church is one of the city's best-known landmarks and is visible throughout the city. It was comissioned in 1937 but not completed until 1986. Just outside the church, you can see a statue of Leif Erikson (c.970- c.1020), which was a gift from the United States in honor of the 1930 Althing Millennial Festival. This festival commemorated the 1000th anniversary of the convening of Iceland's parliament at √ûingvellir.

              <h4>Snorkling in Silfra</h4>
              <p>Silfra, frequently rated as one of the world‚Äôs top ten dive sites, is located between the tectonic plates of Europe and America. Silfra is the only place in the world where you can go snorkeling between the two continents! The crystal clear water comes from Langj√∂kull glacier about 50 km away, and has been filtering through lava for 100-200 years. Make sure you wear warm clothes under your dry suit, because this beautiful adventure is frigid (but totally worth it). </p>
              <h5>Address</h5>
              <p>National park, Thingvellir national park, 801 Thingvellir, Iceland</p>
              <h5>What I like about it...</h5>
              <p>This is truly a unique geographic feature. Although it's absolutely frigid, as soon as you place your mask in the water, the visability is almost 150m. There is something about floating through this pristine water that's meditative.</p>

              <h4>Gullfoss Waterfall</h4>
              <p>Gullfoss (translated to ‚ÄòGolden Falls‚Äô) is one of Iceland‚Äôs most iconic and beloved waterfalls, found in the Hv√≠t√° river canyon in Southwest Iceland. The water in Hv√≠t√° river travels from the glacier Langj√∂kull, before cascading 32 meters (105 feet) down Gullfoss‚Äô two stages in a dramatic display of nature‚Äôs raw power. Geologists believe that this canyon was formed by glacial outbursts at the beginning of the last age.</p>
